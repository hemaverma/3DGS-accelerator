# Product Requirements Document

## 3DGS Video-to-Gaussian Splatting Container

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-11  
**Status:** Draft

---

## 1. Executive Summary

A containerized Rust application that watches a mounted directory for uploaded video folders, extracts frames, processes them through a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) pipeline, and outputs `.ply` and `.splat` files. The container supports both local filesystem mounts and Azure Blob Storage via Blobfuse2.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Users need an automated, containerized solution to convert video captures of real-world scenes into 3D Gaussian Splatting representations. The solution must work seamlessly across edge compute devices and Azure Container Instances, handling files from local storage or Azure Blob Storage without code changes.

---

## 3. Goals & Non-Goals

### Goals

- Watch a mounted directory and automatically process new video uploads
- Extract frames from multiple independent video files
- Extract necessary metadata from the video files, camera positioning, timestamps, etc. to create a manifest file to use with extracted frames
- Generate combined 3DGS output in both `.ply` and `.splat` formats
- Support swappable 3DGS processing backends
- Work identically with local mounts and Azure Blob Storage (via Blobfuse2)
- Run on both x86_64 and arm64 architectures

### Non-Goals (MVP)

- Real-time streaming video processing
- Advanced resource management / adaptive processing
- Separate microservice containers for each pipeline stage
- Web UI or REST API interface

---

## 4. Target Users

**External customers** using the product to generate 3DGS assets from video captures.

---

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Input Handling

| Requirement | Details |
|-------------|---------|
| Input source | Multiple video files (independent captures of the same scene) |
| Supported formats | Common video formats (MP4, MOV, AVI, MKV, WebM) |
| Frame extraction | Container handles extraction from videos |
| Frame selection | User-specified frame count or rate |
| Input validation | Basic validation: file integrity, minimum resolution, sufficient frames |
| Metadata extraction | Extract and generate manifest file (see 5.1.1 below) |

#### 5.1.1 Metadata Extraction & Manifest Generation

For each video file, extract the following metadata to create a manifest file for COLMAP processing:

| Metadata Field | Source | Required | Notes |
|----------------|--------|----------|-------|
| Video filename | File system | Yes | Original video file name |
| Frame count | FFmpeg | Yes | Total frames extracted from this video |
| Frame resolution | FFmpeg | Yes | Width x Height (e.g., 1920x1080) |
| Frame rate (original) | FFmpeg | Yes | FPS of source video |
| Duration | FFmpeg | Yes | Video length in seconds |
| Recording timestamp | Video metadata/EXIF | If available | UTC timestamp of video recording |
| Camera model | Video metadata/EXIF | If available | Device/camera identifier |
| GPS coordinates | Video metadata/EXIF | If available | Latitude/Longitude per frame or video |
| Orientation | Video metadata/EXIF | If available | Device orientation (landscape/portrait/rotation) |

**Manifest File Format:** JSON

**Output Location:** Same directory as extracted frames

**Example manifest.json:**

```json
{
  "job_id": "job-001",
  "processing_timestamp": "2026-02-11T20:30:00Z",
  "videos": [
    {
      "filename": "video1.mp4",
      "frame_count": 120,
      "resolution": "1920x1080",
      "fps": 30.0,
      "duration_secs": 4.0,
      "recording_timestamp": "2026-02-11T18:15:23Z",
      "camera_model": "iPhone 15 Pro",
      "frames": [
        {
          "frame_number": 0,
          "timestamp_offset": 0.0,
          "filename": "video1_frame_0000.jpg"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "camera_intrinsics": {
    "model": "OPENCV",
    "fx": 1000.0,
    "fy": 1000.0,
    "cx": 960.0,
    "cy": 540.0,
    "k1": 0.0,
    "k2": 0.0,
    "p1": 0.0,
    "p2": 0.0
  }
}
```

**Camera Intrinsics Strategy:**

- If EXIF metadata contains focal length: compute intrinsics from sensor size and focal length
- If unavailable: use COLMAP auto-calibration (camera model set to OPENCV)
- Users can override via optional `camera_intrinsics.yaml` file in input folder

### 5.2 Watch Mode Operation

| Concurrent jobs | Queue new folders, process sequentially |

## 15. Open Questions

1. **Default stability timeout** - Is 60 seconds a reasonable default for upload completion detection?
2. **Retry count** - Is 3 retries appropriate before moving to error folder?
3. **Video codecs** - Are there specific codecs that must be supported beyond standard FFmpeg defaults?
4. **Maximum job queue size** - Should there be a limit on queued jobs?
5. **Health check endpoint** - Should the container expose a health check for orchestrators? (Optional HTTP endpoint specified in Section 12.3)
6. **Minimum hardware requirements** - What are the minimum CPU, RAM, and GPU specifications?
7. **Performance targets** - What is acceptable processing time for different video sizes/quantities?

### Answered Questions

1. **~~What happens if container restarts mid-job?~~** - **ANSWERED:** Restart app and reprocess folders (see Section 10, Error Handling)
